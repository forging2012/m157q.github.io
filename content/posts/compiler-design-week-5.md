## NFA (with ε closure) 轉 DFA 

## Minimizing the number of states of a DFA
+ 預設至少兩個 state (至少一個 Final State 和 至少一個 non Final State)
    + 除非證明行為真的不同，只好分更多個 state 出來。
    + Final state 和 non Final state 一定是不同的

## Equivalence Classes
## Relations and Partitions
+ Partition
    + A partition of a set is a collection of mutually disjoint subsets whose union is the original set.
+ If A is a set with a partition and R is the relation induced by the partition, then R is an equivalence relation.
