Just wanna estimate the process time of my algorithm homework.

#Method 1  
```c    
	#include <sys/time.h>    
	    
	struct timeval t_start, t_end;    
	    
	gettimeofday(&t_start, NULL);    
	double start = t_start.tv_sec + (double)t_start.tv_usec / 1000000;    
	    
	//Code to be estimated here    
	    
	gettimeofday(&t_end, NULL);    
	double end = t_end.tv_sec + (double)t_end.tv_usec / 1000000;    
	    
	printf("%f seconds\n", end - start);    
```  
   
This method came from one of my Data Structure homework in last semester.    
    
Can estimated even if the process time is less than one second.    
    
This is the method which I prefer to use.    
    
But, [sys/time.h is a POSIX header, not part of the C/C++ standard library.][1]    
    
So, this method can only be implemented on UNIX system.

#Method 2  
  
```c  
	#include <time.h>    
	    
	clock_t start = clock();    
	    
	//Code to be estimated here    
	    
	clock_t end = clock();    
	    
	printf("%f seconds\n", (end - start) / (float)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);  
```    
  
This method seems be common used.    
    
But, seems it cannot estimate those process time less than one second.    
    
Don't Know why... even if I remove the / (float)CLOCKS_PER_SEC.     
    
It still comes out zero. O_o"
