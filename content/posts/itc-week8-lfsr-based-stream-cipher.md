#  LFSR == Linear Feedback Shift Register  
  
## FSR  
Feedback shift register  
![FSR](/files/itc-week8-lfsr-based-stream-cipher/fsr.jpg)  
**connection polynomial:**  
```mathjax  
C(x) = 1 + C_{1}x + C_{2}x^{2} + \cdots + C_{L}x^{L}  
```  
  
## LFSR  
> If the feedback function is linear, the FSR is called LFSR  
  
i.e.  
```mathjax  
S_{L} = C_{1}S_{L-1} + C_{2}S_{L-2} + \cdots + C_{L}S_0{}  
```  
is linear.  
  
---  
  
```mathjax  
\begin{align}  
  
& \text{If } C(x) \text{ is primitive and the initial state } \\  
& (S_{0}, S_{1}, \cdots , S_{L-1}) \text{ is not zero, } \text{the period is } 2^{L} - 1  
  
\end{align}  
```  
  
> A stream cipher constructed by a LFSR alone is not secure.
