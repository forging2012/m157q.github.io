## Preface  
  
+ YouCompleteMe doesn't work anymore in my Vim.  
+ Got `The ycmd server SHUT DOWN (restart with ':YcmRestartServer')` in status bar everytime Vim starts.  
+ `:YcmRestartServer` always failed.  
+ `:YcmDebugInfo` shows the system path of YouCompleteMe stderr log.  
+ `$ less /tmp/ycmd_52159_stderr_m7n92px1.log`  
+ It shows `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ycm_core'`

## Solution  
  
```sh  
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe  
./install.py --clang-completer  
```  
  
Reinstall YouCompleteMe with Clang completer works.
