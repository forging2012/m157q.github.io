## Doc  
  
```txt  
-name pattern  
    True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches pattern.  
    Special shell pattern matching characters (``['', ``]'', ``*'', and ``?'') may be used as part of pattern.  
    These characters may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a backslash (``\'').  
```  
  
or you can use regular expression for file matching.  
  
```txt  
-regex pattern  
    True if the whole path of the file matches pattern using regular expression.  
    To match a file named ``./foo/xyzzy'', you can use the regular expression ``.*/[xyz]*'' or ``.*/foo/.*'',  
    but not ``xyzzy'' or ``/foo/''.  
```
