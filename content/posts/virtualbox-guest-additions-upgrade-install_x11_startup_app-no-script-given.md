I encountered this problem while I was doing the upgrade for the guest additions of VirtualBox.  
  
### Guest OS: Ubuntu 14.04  
  
Remove the following symlinks before you install the new version of the Guest addtions  
  
`# rm /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/VBoxGuestAdditions`  
`# rm /usr/lib/VBoxGuestAdditions`  
`# rm /usr/share/VBoxGuestAdditions`
