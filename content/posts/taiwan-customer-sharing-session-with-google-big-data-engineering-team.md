# Big Data at Google  
  
## Speaker: Apurva Desai  
  
> Apurva Desai has over 20 years of experience in building software and managing teams.  He has been with early stage startups to big sized companies.   He has been focused on cloud, big data and distributed computing for the last 10+years starting with Yahoo where his team was responsible to manage 20k+ nodes of Hadoop and provide solutions to internal projects migrating to Hadoop ecosystem.

## Reference Architecture  
![Reference Architecture](/files/taiwan-customer-sharing-session-with-google-big-data-engineering-team/reference-architecture.jpg)  
  
  
## Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow  
  
+ Dataflow  
    + API Interface (SDK)  
        + Dataflow model / Beam model  
        + You can write you own sdk with any language  
+ Apache Beam  
  
### Beam vs Spark  
  
+ Classic Batch Processing  
    + Simillar  
+ Windowing  
    + Beam  
        + Window  
        + Sum  
    + Spark  
        + Window & Sum  
+ Late Data  
    + Beam is more easy to implement in this part  
+ Sessions  
  
### Google Cloud Dataflow  
  
+ Fully-managed and auto-configured  
+ Auto graph-optimized for best execution path  
+ Autoscaling mid-job  
+ Dynamic Work Rebalancing mid-job  
+ Fault Tolerant execution of Beam pipelines  
  
  
## Dataproc - Managed Hadoop + Spark  
  
1. Start a massive Hadoop or Spark cluster in 90 seconds  
2. Pre emptible VMs at 30% of othe cost, Custom VMs  
3. Per-minute billing  
4. Separation of Storage + Compute  
5. Incredibly fast networking  
  
### Ephemeral clusters - jobs before clusters  
  
+ Deploy Cluster  
+ Submits jobs  
  
### Separation of Storage and Compute  
  
+ Based on your use cases  
  
  
---  
  
  
## BigQuery  
  
### Fun BigQuery Stats  
  
+ Largest query by rows => 10.5 Trillion rows  
+ Larget query by data size => 2.1 PB  
+ Largest storage customer => 62 PB  
+ Streaming per second => 4.5 million  
  
### BigQuery - explained  
  
1. We just rented ~9000 cores from Google for ~30 seconds  
2. We only paid $20  
3. Most importantly, it's hide from end users.  
4. Users do not thins about cores.  
  
### What is BigQuery?  
  
+ Serveless, Fully Managed, No-Ops Data Warehouse  
+ Petabyte-Scale and Fast  
+ Convenience of SQL  
+ Externalization of Google Dremel  
  
  
## Cloud Pub/Sub - Asynchronous Messaging  
  
1. A FULLY-MANAGED GLOBAL Publish and Subscribe service (a many-to-many queue)  
2. Seamlessly scales to 1,000,000+ QPS  
3. Guaranteed durable at-least-once delivery  
4. 7-day message acknowledgement window  
5. Simple REST API makes it portable
