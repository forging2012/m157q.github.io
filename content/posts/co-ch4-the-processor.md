# Ch4 - The Processor  
  
## Introduction  
  
+ CPU performance factor  
    + Instrction count: Determined by ISA and compiler  
    + CPI and Cycle Time: Determined by CPU hardware  
+ Two MIPS example  
+ Simple subset, shows most aspects  
    + Memory reference: lw, sw  
    + Arithmetic/logical: add, sub, and, or, slt  
    + Control transfer: beq, j

# Instruction Execution  
  
+ PC, instruction memory, fetch instruction  
+ Register numbers, register file, read registers  
+ Depending on instruction class  
  
# CPU Overview  
![CPU Overview](/files/co-ch4-the-processor/cpu_overview.png)  
  
# Mutiplexers  
You should use MUX to join wires together.  
  
# Control  
RegWrite, RegRead, MUX, MemRead, MemWrite, Zero, ALU operation, Branch  
  
# Logic Design Basic  
  
+ Information encoded in binary  
    + Low voltage = 0, High voltage = 1  
    + One wire per bit  
    + Multi-bit data encoded on multi-wire buses  
+ Combinational element  
    + Operate on data  
    + Output is a function of input  
+ State (sequential) elements  
    + Store information  
  
# Combinational Elements  
AND gate, Adder, MUX, ALU  
  
# Sequential Elements  
  
+ Register: stores data in circuit  
    + Uses a clock signal to determine when to update the stored value  
    + **Edge-triggered**: update when Clk changes from 0 to 1  
  
# Performance Issues of Single Cycle Design  
+ Longest delay determines clock period  
    + critical path: **load instruction**  
  
# Clocking Methodology  
  
+ Combinational logic transforms data during clock cycles  
    + Between clock edges  
    + Input from state elements, output to state element  
    + Longest delay determines clock period  
        + ![clock period](/files/co-ch4-the-processor/clock_period.png)  
  
# Building a Datapath  
**Datapath**: Elements that process data and addresses in the CPU. ex: Reg, ALU, MUX, Mem  
  
# Instruction Fetch  
![Instruction Fetch](/files/co-ch4-the-processor/instruction_fetch.png)  
  
# R-Format Instructions  
  
+ Read two register operands  
+ Perform arithmetic/logical operation  
+ Write register result  
  
# Load/Store Instructions  
  
+ Load: Read memory and update register  
+ Store: Write register value to memory  
+ Read register operands  
+ Calculate address using **16-bit** offset  
    + Use ALU, but **sign-extend** offset

# Hazards  
Situations that prevent starting the next instruction in the next cycle  
  
## Structure Hazards  
+ Conflict for use of a resource  
+ In MIPS pipeline with a single memory  
    + Load/store requires data access  
    + Instruction fetch would have to stall for that cycle  
        + Would cause a pipeline “bubble”  
+ Pipelined datapaths require separate instruction/data memories or separate instruction/data caches  
  
## Data Hazards  
An instruction depends on completion of data access by a previous instruction  
  
+ Forwarding (aka Bypassing)  
    + Use result when it is computed  
    + Don’t wait for it to be stored in a register  
    + Requires extra connections in the datapath  
  
+ Load-Use Data Hazard  
    + Can’t always avoid stalls by forwarding  
        + If value not computed when needed  
        + Can’t forward backward in time!  
  
+ Code Scheduling to Avoid Stalls  
    + Reorder code to avoid use of load result in the next instruction  
  
  
## Control Hazards  
  
+ Branch determines flow of control  
    + Fetching next instruction depends on branch outcome  
    + Pipeline can’t always fetch correct instruction  
  
>In MIPS pipeline  
Need to compare registers and compute target early in the pipeline  
Add hardware to do it in ID stage  
  
+ Stall on Branch  
    + Wait until branch outcome determined before fetching next instruction

# Branch Prediction

# Pipeline Summary  
  
+ Pipelining improves performance by increasing instruction throughput  
    + Executes multiple instructions in parallel  
    + Each instruction has the same latency  
  
+ Subject to hazards  
    + Structure  
    + Data  
    + Control  
  
+ Instruction set design affects complexity of pipeline implementation

# MIPS Pipelined Datapath  
From left to right:  
  
1. IF: Instruction fetch  
2. ID: Instruction decode / register file read  
3. EX: Execute / address calculation  
4. MEM: Memory Access  
5. WB: Write Back  
  
> left to right flow leads to hazards  
  
# Pipeline Registers  
![Pipeline Registers](/files/co-ch4-the-processor/pipeline_registers.png)  
  
+ Need registers between stages to hold information produced in previous cycle.  
+ IF and ID are in different instruction cycle, so we need registers.  
+ If some results in this stage won't be used in the next stages, we don't need store those results in the pipeline registers.  
  
# Pipeline Operation  
Cycle-by-cycle flow of instructions through the pipelined datapath  
  
+ **“Single-clock-cycle”** pipeline diagram  
    + Shows pipeline usage in a single cycle  
    + Highlight resources used  
  
+ **“multi-clock-cycle”** pipeline diagram  
    + Graph of operation over time  
  
# Corrected Datapath for Load  
write address should be stored in the pipeline registers.  
![Corrected Datapath for Load](/files/co-ch4-the-processor/corrected_datapath_for_load.png)  
  
# Forwarding Paths  
+ Forwarding Unit  
+ Control Unit  
  
# Forwarding Conditions  
  
```  
// EX hazard  
if (EX/MEM.RegWrite && (EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0))  
{  
    if (EX/MEM.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRs) ForwardA = 10;  
    if (EX/MEM.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRt) ForwardB = 10;  
}  
  
// MEM hazard  
if (MEM/WB.RegWrite && (MEM/WB.RegisterRd != 0))  
{  
    if (MEM/WB.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRs) ForwardA = 01;  
    if (MEM/WB.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRt) ForwardB = 01;  
}  
```  
  
# Double Data Hazard  
  
```asm  
add $1,$1,$2  
add $1,$1,$3  
add $1,$1,$4  
```  
  
+ Both hazards occur -> Want to use the most recent  
+ Revise MEM hazard condition -> Only fwd if EX hazard condition isn’t true  
  
# Revised Forwarding Condition  
  
```  
// MEM hazard  
if (MEM/WB.RegWrite && (MEM/WB.RegisterRd != 0))  
{  
    if ( !(EX/MEM.RegWrite && (EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0)  
    && (EX/MEM.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRs)) )  
    {  
        if (MEM/WB.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRs) ForwardA = 01;  
    }  
  
    if ( !(EX/MEM.RegWrite && (EX/MEM.RegisterRd != 0)  
    && (EX/MEM.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRt)) )  
    {  
        if (MEM/WB.RegisterRd = ID/EX.RegisterRt) ForwardB = 01;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
# Load-Use Hazard Detection  
  
```python  
# Load-use hazard happens when  
ID/EX.MemRead and  
((ID/EX.RegisterRt = IF/ID.RegisterRs) or (ID/EX.RegisterRt = IF/ID.RegisterRt))  
```  
  
+ Check when using instruction is decoded in ID stage  
+ If detected, stall and insert bubble  
+ 對一個 load word 的指令來說，我們要看的是他的 Rt  
  
# How to Stall the Pipeline  
+ Force control values in ID/EX register to 0  
    + EX, MEM and WB do nop (no-operation)  
+ Prevent update of PC and IF/ID register  
    + Using instruction is decoded again  
    + Following instruction is fetched again  
    + 1-cycle stall allows MEM to read data for lw  
  
---  
# Stalls and Performance  
+ Stalls reduce performance  
    + But are required to get correct results  
+ Compiler can arrange code to avoid hazards and stalls  
    + Requires knowledge of the pipeline structure  
  
---  
# Reducing Branch Delay  
+ Move hardware to determine outcome to ID stage  
    + Target address adder  
    + Register comparator  
+ Example: Branch taken  
  
> 把 branch 決定的時間從 stage4 提早到 stage2,  
在 stage2 才會知道這個 branch 是否會被 taken  
決定的時間越早越好, 最早就是在 stage2 決定  
  
---  
# Data Hazards For Branches  
If a comparison register is a destination of  
+ 2nd or 3rd preceding ALU instruction  
    + Can resolve using forwarding  
+ preceding ALU instruction or 2nd preceding load instruction  
    + Need 1 stall cycle  
+ immediately preceding load instruction  
    + Need 2 stall cycles
