### Introduction to Computer Security HW1  
  
1. Select a web site.  
    + Use “Wget” or “Teleport Pro” to mirror the site. Look for comments within comment tags. Give screen dumps and explain what you found.  
        + Screen Dumps & Explanations  
            + I've found some hidden targets that not be shown on the home page of <http://www.nctu.edu.tw>. These website probably still working but out of date or have already be deprecated that nobody maintain the website and may have some flaws. Below is the lists.

                + Maybe there some something useful in these index.php files.  
2. Lookup “How I met your girlfriend” in the BlackHat 2010 demo to explain, in 0.5 page, how this was done.

> The speaker first study on the session mechanism of the Facebook.

> The Entropy had be redurced from the initial 160 bits to only 20 bits!! He kept tracing the source code and hacking it.  
> Then, he used a techical skill called "NAT pinning" to confuse the router at protocol level.  
> After that, he also used the IRC bot, Geoloction via XSS and HTML5 anti-WAF XSS.  
> Combined all these skills and analysized based on those results.  
> Finally, he used the triangle localization to find someone's girlfriend in reality.  
3. Select a person. Use on-line sites for phone book, social network, information, job, photo management, business directory, jigsaw.com, etc. to summarize, with screen dumps and explanations, what information you can get. If your target is not in US nor native English speaker, you might need to use on-line sites different from the textbook.
