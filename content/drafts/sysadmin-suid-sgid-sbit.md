SUID (Set UID) (chmod 4xxx)    
      
    On binary executing file: (ex: ping, passwd)    
        give the person who run the file temporary permission same as the file owner. (Can't be used on script!)    
      
    On directory: Useless    
    
    
    
SGID (Set GID) (chmod 2xxx)    
    
    On binary executing file:    
        The person who run the file temporarily becomes a member of the file's Group Owner. (Can't be used on script!)    
    
    On directory:    
        All the files and directories which are created under this directory will have the same Group Owner as this directory.    
    
    
    
SBIT (Sticky Bit) (chmod 1xxx)    
      
    On directory: (ex: /tmp)    
            If a user has write and execute permission in this directory. Then all the files and directories created by him/her could only be deleted by himself/herself or by root. It usually be used to create a shared directory. ex: directories on FTP server.    
    
    On file:     
        Setting the sticky bit on a file is pretty much useless, and it doesn’t   
do anything. On some of the older *nix flavors, a sticky bit enabled executable   
file will be loaded to the swap memory after 1st execution, which speeds up   
all subsequent execution. This is not true anymore.[2] (For more details also   
see [4])
